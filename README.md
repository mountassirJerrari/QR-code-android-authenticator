# QR CODE AUTHENTICATOR

The idea behind this project is to  bring the security of asymmetric encryption to devices with limited IO interfaces or software support, such as Smart TVs or public internet terminals. instead of providing username and password, the TV fro exemple presents a QRcode on its screen. the user opens the authentication app , and scans the QR-code with his smartphone, finally the user grants the Smart TV to access the protected service.
